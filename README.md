# webscrape_cities
Web scraping of countries and their cities/towns

This project is meant to demonstrate web scraping capabilities.

The website https://www.worldcitydb.com/search-by-country?lang=en_US, containes information
of countries and their respective cities and towns.

The program classifies this data into a python dictionary structure where each town in a city
is added to an array. The array is then added as a value to a city in a dictionary format.

Each country contains a dictionary of cities and their towns.

This process is repeated for each country in the link above.
